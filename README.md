# DOM MANIPULATION

This is my assignment for "Javascript In The Browser - DOM Manipulation & Timing".
[Go to the guide](https://io.tskoli.dev/guides/5f1332acb279dc27c467cac8)

### What did I do?

I took the structure from my first Website and added Javascript:

1. WHO ARE YOU?
   I added added a personalized welcome message using [this tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Getting_started_with_the_web/JavaScript_basics)

2. TIME OUT

- I created a countdown using [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_a4XCarxwr8)
- I added an alert at the end of the countdown using [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_win_setinterval.asp)

3. MAKE A LIST
   I created a function to make an li list using [this tutorial](https://youtu.be/wiozYyXQEVk)

4. REMOVE FROM A LIST
   I created a function to remove items from a list using [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/met_element_remove.asp)

5. Preloader
   I created a preloader using [this tutorial](https://css-tricks.com/lets-make-a-fancy-but-uncomplicated-page-loader/)
   I encountered some problems, mostly with the preloader. When I added it, the other functions did not work, such as "Who are you". Then I found the solution hidden in the comments of the tutorial, I had to add "pointer-events: none;" into the CSS.

6. DARK MODE
   I created a toggle button to switch between dark and light mode using [this tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/howto/howto_js_toggle_dark_mode.asp)

I made it simple and tried to understand everything I did.
I also styled some elements with CSS with JavaScript.
